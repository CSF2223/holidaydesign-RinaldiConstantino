			<p> In the Southern Hemisphere, the “winter” holidays fall during the summer. Australian temperatures can get as warm as 84 degrees Fahrenheit around Christmas.
So naturally, many Australians head to the beach. Families and friends partake in swimming, picnics and volleyball. Often, some surfing Santas will make an
appearance. A couple of Sydney beaches are known to be a hotspot for foreign travelers and backpackers. In recent years the wild parties thrown there have
gotten so out of hand that alcohol bans have been implemented.

			<p>Christmas may get a lot of attention, but Boxing Day on December 26 is a major holiday in its own right. According to legend,
the holiday got its start when wealthy people in England brought food and other gifts to those who worked for them after Christmas.
That spirit of generosity remains, but the holiday has also evolved to be more festive. In some places, like Canada, Hong Kong, and England, stores hold major sales on December 26, making it one of the year’s biggest days for shopping.
In the Bahamas, Boxing Day plays host to the Junkanoo festival, with a huge parade full of costumes and music. And Australia and New Zealand take advantage of the Southern Hemisphere’s summer weather by celebrating with big sporting events! </p> 

					<h1 class='altitle'> Burning Of The Devil (Guatemala)</h1>

			<p> Guatemalans get fired up for Christmas. Literally. December 6 marks La Quema del Diablo (“the Burning of the Devil”), which is when families
in Guatemala set bonfires outside of their homes and burn effigies of Satan to expunge evil spirits, celebrating the victory of good over evil.
In the past, people would bring out all the trash from their houses and set it alight, and some still do. In the wake of environmental backlash,
however, many people stick to burning piñatas shaped like the Devil. This celebration is accompanied by traditional donuts and warm fruit punch,
and it signifies the start of the Christmas season.
